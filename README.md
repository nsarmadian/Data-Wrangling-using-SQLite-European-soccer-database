data analysis of European soccer database using SQLite.
SQLite on Jupyter notebook (Python 3) is used to get the basic information about this database.

European Soccer Database can be downloaded from:
https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer

This is an ultimate Soccer database for data analysis and machine learning
What you get:
+25,000 matches
+10,000 players
11 European Countries with their lead championship
Seasons 2008 to 2016
Players and Teams' attributes* sourced from EA Sports' FIFA video game series, including the weekly updates
Team line up with squad formation (X, Y coordinates)
Betting odds from up to 10 providers
Detailed match events (goal types, possession, corner, cross, fouls, cards etcâ€¦) for +10,000 matches

Beside the code, I plot and provide the ERD for this database in order to understand the relation between the tables clearly.

The code is mainly about undestanding a database and getting basic information using JOIN and CONSTSAINTS.
